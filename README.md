# Spectral Analysis of Astronomical Data
Spectral analysis of astronomical data using Fourier and Morlet wavelet transforms.

## Running the notebook
If you want to run one of the notebooks of this repository, you just have to clone it on your computer using `git clone https://github.com/gbogopolsky/spectral-analysis-astro.git`.

Then, using Anaconda, create the virtual environment and run the Jupyter Notebook kernel:
```bash
conda create --name spectral-analysis --file requirements.txt
source activate spectral-analysis
jupyter notebook
```
And you're good to go. Enjoy!

## Thanks
I would like to thank Olga Alexandrova and Baptiste Cecconi from the LESIA lab of OBSPM for organising this practical session. Thanks also to C. Torrence, G. Compo and E. Predybaylo for developing the wavelet tranform routine in Python.
